        <h class="a">Healthy food and Exercise</h><br>
        <h class="b">Count on the right carbohydrates<h><br>
        <h class="c">Thanks to low-carb fad diets, carbohydrates have gotten a bad rap. But carbohydrates are your body’s main source of energy. <br>
        According to the Mayo Clinic, about 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calories should come from carbohydrates. <br>
        This is especially true if you exercise.<br><br>
        Choosing the right kind of carbohydrates is important. Too many people rely on the simple carbs found in sweets and processed foods.<br> 
        Instead, you should focus on eating the complex carbs found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and beans. <br>
        Whole grains have more staying power than refined grains because you digest them more slowly. <br>
        They can help you feel full for longer and fuel your body throughout the day. They can also help stabilize your blood sugar levels.<br> 
        Finally, these quality grains have the vitamins and minerals you need to keep your body running at its best.</h><br><br>
        <h class="b">Pack protein into your snacks and meals</h><br>
        <h class="c">Protein is needed to help keep your body growing, maintained, and repaired. For example, <br>
        the University of Rochester Medical Center reports that red blood cells die after about 120 days. <br>
        Protein is also essential for building and repairing muscles, helping you enjoy the benefits of your workout. <br>
        It can be a source of energy when carbohydrates are in short supply, but it’s not a major source of fuel during exercise you’re well-fed.<br><br>
        Adults need to eat about 0.8 grams of protein per day for every kilogram of their body weight, reports Harvard Health Blog. <br>
        That’s equal to about 0.36 grams of protein for every pound of body weight. Exercisers and older people may need even more. <br>
        That protein can come from:
        <ul>
            <li>poultry, such as chicken and turkey</li>
            <li>red meat, such as beef and lamb</li>
            <li>fish, such as salmon and tuna</li>
            <li>dairy, such as milk and yogurt</li>
            <li>legumes, such as beans and lentils</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
        </ul>
        For the healthiest options, choose lean proteins that are low in saturated and trans fats. <br>
        Limit the amount of red meat and processed meats that you eat.</h><br><br>
        <h class="b">Boost your fruit and vegetable intake</h1><br>
        <h class="c">Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of natural fiber, vitamins, minerals, and other compounds <br>
        that your body needs to function properly. They’re also low in calories and fat.<br><br>
        Aim to fill half your plate with fruits and veggies at every meal, recommends the United States Department of Agriculture.<br> 
        Try to “eat the rainbow” by choosing fruits and veggies of different colors. This will help you enjoy the full range of vitamins,<br> 
        minerals, and antioxidants that the produce aisle has to offer. Every time you go to the grocery store, <br>
        considering choosing a new fruit or vegetable to try. For snacks, keep dried fruits in your workout bag and raw veggies in the fridge.</h><br><br>
        <h class="b">Balance is key</h><br>
        <h class="c">As you settle into an active lifestyle, you’ll probably discover which foods give you the most energy and which have negative effects. <br>
        The key is learning to listen to your body and balancing what feels right with what’s good for you. Follow these tips:
        <ul>
            <li>Aim to make breakfast a part of your routine.</li>
            <li>Choose complex carbohydrates, lean protein sources, healthy fats, and a wide variety of fruits and veggies.</li>
            <li>Stock your fridge and gym bag with healthy workout snacks.</li>
        </ul>
        The right balance of carbohydrates, protein, and other nutrients can help fuel your exercise routine.</h><br><br>
